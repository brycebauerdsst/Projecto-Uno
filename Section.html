            In 2017 the Solar eclipse path crossed North America. This single event proves the <a <href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/trevornace/2017/08/22/flat-earthers-declare-solar-eclipse-just-proved-earth-flat/#ee1732569216">Earth</a> is Flatt! Now image a coin. A coin is flat. When you spin the coin the coin looks like it is a globe. The flatt earth is spinning so fast it looks like a globe, thus everyone thinks the is is round. It's a common mistake.

          <p class='bodytext'> Taking a few step back in history to the dinosuars, the dinosuars were all wiped off the earth. There is no dought about that, however many believe an astroid wiped them all out. This is incorrect. An astroid did inderectly kill the dinosuars though. hen the astroid hit earth it sent all the dinosuars off into space.

            <p class='bodytext'>Well it's simple, a 150-foot-tall wall of ice, around the rim. NASA employee's guard this ice wall to prevent people from climbing over and falling off the disc. The leader of this masive cover up by NASA is the one and only Santa Claus. Below is a rair picture of the head of NASA who runs the Wall.

      A common problem in todays society is the debate on whether global warming is real or not. First of all, if it was real, it isn't called global warming, it is called cylidrical warm. If cylidrical was real the great ice wall would have melted and people would be walking off the end of Earth, which people arn't.
